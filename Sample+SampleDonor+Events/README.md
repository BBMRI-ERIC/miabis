# MIABIS Sample, Sample Donor and Event (individual-level)

In response to the need for more detailed information, MIABIS has extended its terminology to include individual-level components, describing samples, sample donors, and events. These entities enhance the ability to perform sophisticated queries. Ongoing developments include an additional component describing molecular pathology.

MIABIS represents the minimum information required to initiate collaborations between biobanks and to enable the exchange of biological samples and data. The aim is to facilitate the reuse of bio-resources and associated data by harmonizing biobanking and biomedical research.

The attributes are defined in accordance with epidemiological literature and terminology.

MIABIS consists of three "core" components: Biobanks and Samples Collections and Study. Additional components currently under evaluation include, OMICS, Participant, Rare diseases, Samples and Sample Quality.

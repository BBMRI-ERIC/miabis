# MIABIS Core

The MIABIS Core, crucial for initiating collaboration and enabling sample and data exchange, comprises four main entities: Biobank, Collection, Research Resource, and Network. MIABIS Core 3.0 ([Eklund et al., 2024](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/bio.2023.0074)) further refines these attributes, providing a modular structure for easy adherence and extension.

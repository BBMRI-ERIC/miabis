# MIABIS: Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing

The Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing (MIABIS) aims to standardize data elements used to describe biobanks, research on samples and associated data. The MIABIS standard works on several levels: General data to describe biobanks, sample collections and studies at an aggregated/metadata level is described in MIABIS Core 2.0. Additional MIABIS modules are currently suggested on the wiki pages, such as Biological Experiment, Participant, Rare diseases, Samples and Quality. However these have not been finalized yet and should be considered as draft suggestions.

The work on the MIABIS modules follows the new MIABIS governance model introduced in 2016 by BBMRI-ERIC. MIABIS is developed by working groups with voluntary participants from different BBMRI-ERIC national nodes as well as other domain experts. 

## MIABIS 2.0 Core:
MIABIS Core 2.0 represents the minimum information required to initiate collaborations between biobanks and to enable the exchange of biological samples and data. The aim is to facilitate the reuse of bio-resources and associated data by harmonizing biobanking and biomedical research. The attributes are defined in accordance with epidemiological literature and terminology.

MIABIS Core 2.0 consists of three main components: "Biobank", "Samples Collection" and "Study". 

* [Data describing Biobank](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Biobank)
* [Data describing Sample Collection](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample-Collection)
* [Data describing Study](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Study)
* [Entire list of attributes](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Entire-list-of-attributes)

## Additional components (currently under proposal, NOT FINAL):

* [Data describing Sample](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample)
* [Data describing Quality](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample-Quality)
* [Data describing Biological Experiment](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Biological-Experiment)
* [Data describing Sample Donor](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample-Donor)
* [Data describing Rare diseases](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Rare-Diseases)

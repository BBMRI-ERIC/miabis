# MIABIS: Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing (version 2.0)

MIABIS 2.0 represents the minimum information required to initiate collaborations between biobanks and to enable the exchange of biological samples and data. The aim is to facilitate the reuse of bio-resources and associated data by harmonizing biobanking and biomedical research.

The attributes are defined in accordance with epidemiological literature and terminology.

MIABIS 2.0 Core consists of three main components: "Biobank", "Samples Collection" and "Study". Additional components currently under evaluation include, Biological Experiment, Participant, Rare diseases, Samples and Quality.

## Core components of MIABIS 2.0 (as defined within the MIABIS working group):

* [Data describing Biobank](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Biobank)
* [Data describing Sample Collection] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample-Collection)
* [Data describing Study] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Study)
* [Entire list of attributes] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Entire-list-of-attributes)

## Additional components (currently under proposal, NOT FINAL):

* [Data describing Sample] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample)

* [Data describing Biological Experiment] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Biological-Experiment)
* [Data describing Participant] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Participant)
* [Data describing Rare diseases] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Rare-Diseases)

# MIABIS: Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing

MIABIS represents the minimum information required to initiate collaborations between biobanks and to enable the exchange of biological samples and data. The aim is to facilitate the reuse of bio-resources and associated data by harmonizing biobanking and biomedical research.

The attributes are defined in accordance with epidemiological literature and terminology.

MIABIS consists of three "core" components: Biobanks and Samples Collections and Study. Additional components currently under evaluation include, OMICS, Participant, Rare diseases, Samples and Sample Quality.

## Core components of MIABIS 2.0 (as defined within the MIABIS working group):

* [Data describing Biobanks](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Biobank)
* [Data describing Sample Collections] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample-Collections)
* [Data describing Studies] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Studies)
* [Entire list of attributes] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Entire-list-of-attributes)

## Additional components (currently under proposal, NOT FINAL):

* [Data describing Samples] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Samples)
* [Data describing Sample Quality] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Sample-Quality)
* [Data describing OMICS] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-OMICS)
* [Data describing Participant] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Participant)
* [Data describing Rare diseases] (https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki/Data-describing-Rare-Diseases)

## Structured data and lists:

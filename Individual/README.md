# MIABIS Sample, Sample Donor, and Event (individual level)

In response to the need for more detailed information, MIABIS has extended its terminology to include individual level components, describing samples, sample donors, and events. These entities enhance the ability to perform sophisticated queries. Ongoing developments include an additional component describing molecular pathology.

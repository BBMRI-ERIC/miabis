MIABIS working group update 15.04.21

Attendees: Andrzej Strug (AS), Cäcilia Engels (CE), Enrico Glerean (EG), Gabi Anton (GA), Heimo Müller (HM), Michael Hummel (MH), Michael Neumann (MN), Niina Eklund (NE), Robert Rehis (RR), Ronny Baber (RB), Zdenka Dudová (ZD), 

## MIABIS scope: 
"data describing" (just describing the attributes in a modelled way) -> Directory is the use case/implementation for "data sharing"
MIABIS-work: sort out terminology to give biobanks the tools to describe their data, hence: "Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing (MIABIS)"
Range for MIABIS core 3.0: organisational-level (networks, biobanks, collections/studies) + content-level (samples + omics + donor) https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bio.2019.0129

## Use case: Directory 
To be implemented within Molgenis technology in the BBMRI-ERIC Directory & Biobank Finder (RD-Connect)

### Open questions: 
 - Can "collection" be replaced by the different filters? Or is there another definition (ownership, consent, contact point)?
 - Is the term "data objects" needed, or can there just be the data objects give: OMICS, imaging, etc. and further upcoming "data objects".
 - Who (except for the Directory) will employ MIABIS? Sample Locator, BP-Query,...?
 - Which existing terminologies can be used? OMOP https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/, FHIR https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html, SCT, DICOM,...?

**Homework** ☝️
 - @AS: Gather data for imaging -> as input into discussion
 - @CE: Ask Petr concerning the possibility to use SCT for MIABIS? / gather sample material types (SCT) / gather clinical data for donor description -> as input into discussion
 - @NE & AS: Mapping of current directory to future MIABIS

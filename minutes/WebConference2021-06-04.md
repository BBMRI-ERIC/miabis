Discussion:
Derived from the "requests to biobank" insights: discussion on inclusion of "selected" clinical data into MIABIS. Which belong into the MIABIS-core? The rest will be described in “extensions” tbd.
Need to incorporate the attributes from the Covid19 extension of "biobank capabilities/services" into MIABIS. Which belong into the MIABIS-core? The rest will be described in “extensions” tbd.
Suggestions for further extensions (as opposed to the core):
 - Clinical information
 - Imaging
 - Biobank capabilities
 - OMICS
Need to revisit the scope of MIABIS Core v3 work Kaisa and Niina wrote in 2019
Scope of MIABIS update: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFgVzRLUm0P2eM62fYU5rCVAufKuIiTvzgIbUe8dpGg/edit
 - MIABIS Core v3 should describe the availability of data/samples, and all the attributes included in the terminology should be presented on aggregated level (yes/no). The more detailed level to complement the data should be presented in the extensions.
 - Keep MIABIS Core on minimal and simple and introduce any complexity in the extensions.
 - Data availability is needed for the MIABIS core, all details should be in their extensions.

MIABIS-governance: 
MIABIS-working group delivers a proposal based on their scope and discussions. This proposal is then reviewed by e.g. people from the directory team etc. and needs lastly to be agreed on in BBMRI-ERIC MC
Differentiation between MIABIS (standard) and the Directory (use case): The Directory includes the core 2.0 the imaging-extension, but not the sample/donor-extension. MIABIS does not need to comply with the BBMRI-ERIC Directory. MIABIS is a standalone terminology that the Directory implements, but not completely. The Directory implements MIABIS but can freely extend the model used in the Directory and even use older version of MIABIS if liked.

Account of Michael Neumann on first steps of applying the star model on the RD-connect data/directory to visualise the possibility and test the scalability (work done with Robert Rheis and his students in Graz). - > Proof of concept

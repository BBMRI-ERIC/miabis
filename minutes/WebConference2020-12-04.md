Participants: AS, NE, MN, CE, BG, GA, KS, ND, PH, (RB)

## Star model for MIABIS
Facts with dimensions: Which dimensions do we need and what characterises them?
Start with small set of dimensions: 
 - **Disease** (diagnosis)
 - **Donor** (gender, age)
 - **Sample** (type, temperature)
 - **OMICS** (?)
 
 ## The declared goal for this model is, that any biobank is able to fill in some information

(KS = Kaisa Silander, NE = Niina Eklund, GA = Gabi Anton, MN = Michael Neumann, CE = CÃ¤cilia Engels, AS = Andrzel Strug)

 + @KS & @NE collect requests and describe **OMICS**-dimension by attributes, such as Genomics, Transcriptomics,...
 + @GA & @MN & @CE fill in further facts for **donor**, **disease** and **sample** and pass their results on to @AS, for further additions
 + @CE coordinates next meeting for January 2021
 + @AS proposes a new description for biobanks and their services

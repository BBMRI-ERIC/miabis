## Biobank capabilities

To update the tables for "Capabilities" and for "Services provided by the biobank" (COVID-19-specific) within the Directory and to anchor this element in MIABIS, AS presented a list aggregated together with his biobank-specialists: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bROvb28ZUSQl2cvFtfMfLtCoA1-7xagZ/edit#gid=1000702607 

The group agrees that this would not contradict the postulate of MIABIS to include biobanks that do not store actual samples, but the sample data.

The list is grouped into "bioprocessing capabilities" vs. "technical and organisational capabilities" other groupings discussed were: data storage vs. data analytics

What is the exact purpose to list "biobank capabilities" in the Directory? (F.e. Swedish biobanks distinguish between the biobank = bank and additional analysis = collaborative lab)
**-> provide sample processing for storage**
**-> provide service to procure/extract data**

**Homework** ☝️ 
@CE: Create a voting table for the list of "Biobank capabilities" and send to the entire MIABIS WG for vote of which truly (and only!) biobank-specific sample preparation/processing and storage "capabilities" they offer at their biobanks.
@AS: Proposal of a new MIABIS-group to further elaborated the remaining items on the list.

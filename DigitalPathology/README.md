# Scope of the MIABIS Digital Pathology (individual-level)

## Motivation
The fields of medicine and pathology are increasingly reliant on Digital Pathology and AI algorithms. Digital Pathology involves converting glass slides into digital images that can be analyzed using computer algorithms. AI algorithms are developed to aid in diagnosing diseases like cancer and predicting patient outcomes, thereby helping in making informed treatment decisions.  Due to generating large volumes of whole slide imaging (WSI) data sets, cataloging is necessary at both resource and individual patient/case/digital specimen levels.

## Objective & Scope
Whole Slide Image (WSI) catalogues in Digital Pathology. Aiming for a minimal metadata set for specimens (blocks, slides) and their digitised form (scans).

|---|---|---|---|---|
Scan Identifier | A unique identifier of the scan | 1:1 | Identifier (String) | To be distinguished from the File Identifier, i.e. for a (glass) slide there can be multiple scans, each with a unique ID, and each scan can again have several representations in a digital file (WSI) |

Container Condition | Condition of the scanned glass slide and cover slip | 0:1 | String | Description of the glass slide condition, preparation steps (cleaning) of the glass slide. May be relevant in archive scanning |
Device | Name of the device and manufacturer of the equipment / scanner | 1:1 | String | The description should contain the Vendor Name and the device name, e.g. "3D HISTECH Ltd; PANNORAMIC® 1000 DX" or "Leica Biosystems; Aperio GT 450" |
Device Identifier | Unique Identifier of the device used | 1:1 | Identifier (String) | e.g. the Serial Number of the Scanner used |
Device Software Version | Software / Firmware versions of the device used | 0:1 | String | To be distinguished from the version of the image format -> CAVEAT: Alignment with Services component "Device" and Dataset component "Technology" needed!|
Scanning Operation Mode | Identifies the mode of image acquisition procedure | 0:1 | Controlled Value Set: ‘Manual’; ‘Semi-Automatic’; ‘Automatic’ | Relevant e.g. for scanning of archive slides, were the scan area and focus points are set manually |
Depth of Field | The thickness of the specimen that is acceptably sharp at a given focus level given in meter (m) | 0:1 | Number | 0.000005 = depth of field of 5 μm [Depth of Field and Depth of Focus Nikon’s MicroscopyU] https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/depth-of-field-and-depth-of-focus |
Focus Stacking | Method of the Focus Stacking | 1:1 | Controlled Value Set: ‘Single’; ‘Multiple’; ‘Extended’ | Single = one image layer generated by one focal plane in  scanning; Multiple = n image layers generated by n focal planes in scanning; Extended = one image layer generated by the combination of n focal planes in scanning [Focus stackin] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_stacking#:~:text=Focus%20stacking%20(also%20known%20as,of%20the%20individual%20source%20images. |
Number of Focal Planes | Number of focal planes captured or used for extended depth of field | 0:1 | Number (integer) | Could be mandatory and the default value = 1 |
Distance between Focal Planes | Distance between acquisition focal planes given in meter (m) | 0:1 | Number | 0.00002 = distance of 20 μm  |
Scan Area | Area scanned given in mm q2 | 1:1 | Number | This attribute may vary across different scanners for the same glass slide; for instance, some vendors might not scan areas such as lumens. |
Scanning Magnification | The magnification chosen for the acquisition of whole slide images | 1:1 | Controlled Value Set: CID 8132. Magnification Selection | e.g. ‘5X’, ‘10x’, ‘20x’, ‘40x’ - The magnification does not correspond to the same spatial resolution across all vendors |
Spatial Resolution | Dimensions of a pixel in an image, measured in meter (m) | 1:1 | Number | 0.0000005 is the spatial resolution of a WSI scanned with 0,5 μm / pixel |
Illumination Method | Microscopy Illumination Method | 0:1 | Controlled Value Set: CID 8123. Microscopy Illumination Method | e.g. ‘Transmission illumination’, ‘Reflection illumination’, ‘Epifluorescence illumination’, ‘Brightfield illumination’, ‘Darkfield illumination’, ‘Oblique illumination‘, ‘Phase contrast illumination‘, ‘Differential interference contrast‘, ‘Total internal reflection fluorescence‘ |
Illumination WaveLength | Nominal wavelength of the illuminator in nm | 0:1 | number | Could be a single wavelength, a wavelength range, or an array of wavelength information |
Illumination Color Code | Color of the illuminator used during whole slide image acquisition | 0:1 | Controlled Value Set: CID 8122. Microscopy Illuminator and Sensor Color | e.g. ’Full Spectrum’, ’Infrared’, ’Red’, ’Green’, ’Blue’, ’Ultraviolet’ |
Out-of-Focus Error Rate | Percentage of scanned area, which is out of focus | 0:1 | Number | 5 = 5% of the scanned area has some out of focus problem |
Stitching and Other Artefact Error Rate | Percentage of the scanned area affected by stitching errors or other scanning artifacts | 0:1 | Number | 5 = 5% of the scanned area has some scanning artifacts; Only scanning artefacts should be reported here, i.e. tissue folding would be covered by a quality attribute of the glass slide (container) |

| Scanning Operation Mode   | Automatic (digitization without any interference from the personnel responsible), Semi-automatic (digitization with minimal interference from the personnel responsible), Manual (the personnel responsible adjust several parameters during the digitization procedure) |               |      |
| Z-Stacking                | single (one image layer generated by one focal plane in scanning), multiple (n image layers generated by n focal planes in scanning), extended (one image layer generated by the combination of n focal planes in scanning)                                              |               |      |
| Color Space               | multispectral (the channels can be mapped to a specific light spectrum),                                                                                                                                                                                                 |               |      |
| Compression Quality Level | 85 = Compression Quality Level of 85% e.g. for a JPEG Lossy Compression 100 denotes a lossless compression                                                                                                                                                               |               |

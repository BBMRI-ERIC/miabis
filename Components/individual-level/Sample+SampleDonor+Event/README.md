## Scope of the MIABIS Sample and Sample Donor Component
The development of the MIABIS Sample and Sample Donor components was guided by principles established by experts from BBMRI-ERIC's CS IT, with approval from the Management Committee. Six guiding principles form the foundation for defining these components:

* Human-origin Samples: The components focus solely on samples of human origin.
* Applicability and Extensions: They are applicable to all sample types and donors, with extensions introduced by domain-specific MIABIS modules.
* Flexibility in Data Structure: Hierarchical structures within components are not defined, allowing flexibility for different use-cases and infrastructures to define data structures as needed.
* Current Sample Status: The sample component captures information on the current status of stored samples, excluding handling and processing history.
* Independence and Searchability: Each component is independent and searchable on its own, with no dependencies on other sources except between sample and sample donor.
* Use of Predefined Data Terminologies: Predefined terminologies are utilized where available, including attributes from MIABIS Core 2.0.
